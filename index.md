## Welcome bioslaD homepage!

With big data comes the need to for software pieces that can run faster, safer. This is especially true for distributed and cloud environments where time and computation resources are money. A programming language which inherit and learns from the success of C and C++, while remedying their downsides, will be an optimal choice for this era. 

D is a modern general-purpose programming language at the sweet spot of maintainability, productivity and speed. It can interoperate well with C and C++. This gives possibility to migrate gradually to D from C and C++. 

bioslaD is a collection of bioinformatic tools written in D programming language. Tools may be newly written in D or, for popular tools, translated from other languages (i.e. C and C++)
The motivation is to act as an incubator for high performance bioinformatic tools, which are showcases of safe and fast applications written in D. We welcome fellow programmers, bioinformaticians, and enthusiasts to join the development.
